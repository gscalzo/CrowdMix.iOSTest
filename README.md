# CrowdMix.iOSTest

You must implement an iOS app that allows you to add and withdraw money from your bank account ans shows statements

## Features
* as a user I want to add money to my bank account
* as a user I want to withdraw money from my bank account
* as a user I want to see the list of the bank statements

## UX

## Rules
* Split the features to implement in complete task to show the value to the stakeholders
* Write as many tests that make you confident to write a well crafted app
* The goal is to build a robust and well designed app, not to deliver all the features but with crappy code
